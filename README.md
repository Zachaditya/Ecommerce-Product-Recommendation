# Ecommerce-Product-Recommendation
E-commerce Product Recommendation System
Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

This project is essentially a search engine designed to suggest products to users based on their search queries. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity, the system analyzes product descriptions and matches them to user's input to the search bar giving the most similar products.

Features

Search Query Processing: Preprocesses user queries using NLP techniques, including tokenization and text normalization.
Product Matching: Computes cosine similarity between search queries and product descriptions to rank and recommend the most relevant items.
Efficient Recommendations: Delivers personalized recommendations in real-time, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
NLTK or SpaCy for text preprocessing
Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code
Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:
Load product dataset containing names, descriptions, and other metadata.
Clean and preprocess text data (remove stop words, tokenize, and normalize).
Feature Engineering:
Apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical vectors.
Similarity Calculation:
Use cosine similarity to measure relevance between user queries and product descriptions.
Recommendation Generation:
Rank products based on similarity scores and return the top recommendations.
Performance Evaluation:
Test the recommendation system with various user queries to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
Example Use Case

Given the time for improvements:
- I would make the website much more aesthetic
- I would create a recommendation based on the user's purchases, actively implementing a database using XAMPP
- I would create a more robust machine learning algorithm given more data by clustering similar users together and creating a recommendation algorithm for similar users
- I would add more webpages to make the website more functional
- 
Suppose a user searches for "wireless earbuds." The system processes the query, computes cosine similarity with all product descriptions in the dataset, and recommends products such as:

"Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancellation"
"True Wireless Stereo Earbuds"
"Wireless Earphones with Charging Case"
